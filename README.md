## Attribution
Below are listed all of the important components of this repo, and any attributions for source material (other than official docs/wikis) that I either used directly or used as a base for customization.

### [Midst](https://midst.co/)
An excellent narrative podcast that I love, which happens to have an amazing aesthetic. The original versions of the ship image and dark wallpaper are from their member site.

### [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)
My config just changes some `$HOME` icons.

### [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)
I just used the wiki, and **jp2a** to generate the ASCII logo.

### [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
Nothing special, my config just adds a few aliases, runs **starship**, and configures **fastfetch** startup behavior.

### [hyprland](https://hypr.land/)
Modules/programs used: [hyprpaper](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/), [hyprshot](https://github.com/Gustash/Hyprshot), [hyprnome](https://github.com/donovanglover/hyprnome), [hyprlock](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprlock/), [hyprpolkitagent](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpolkitagent/), [hyprpicker](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpicker/)

### [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
I created the theme by picking and adjusting colors from the wallpaper image. Fira Code Nerd Font for ligatures and nerd icons.

### [logiops](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops)
Makes my mouse work, so nice.

### [mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako)
Just used the man page.

### [starship](https://starship.rs/)
I used the [Tokyo Night preset](https://starship.rs/presets/tokyo-night.html) as a base, and changed the colors around.

### [tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi)
I just changed the colors from the official [fullscreen theme](https://github.com/philj56/tofi/blob/master/themes/fullscreen).

### [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
Used the wiki and some of the example custom modules as reference, but pretty much all my work.


### [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)
Just changed some keybinds, because I'm a WASD pleb.

### [firefox]()
I'm using [this black theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2black/) (it's the best one, I tried every one on Mozilla's addon store), and I used [this post](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1411474) as a reference to make the little "mute tab" button non-clickable.

### [sddm](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/)
I customized the [Obscure SDDM Theme](https://github.com/saatvik333/obscure-sddm-theme), and [this forum post](https://forum.garudalinux.org/t/sddm-on-multiple-monitors-duplicated-display-incorrect-layout-and-incorrect-focus-issues/40822/7) helped me figure out how to turn off my secondary monitor when SDDM is displayed.
